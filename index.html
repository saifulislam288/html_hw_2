	<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
	
	<p>Why do we use it?
	It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <i>'Content here, content here',</i> <strong>making it look like readable English.</strong> 

    Where does it come from?
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
